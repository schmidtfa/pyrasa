PyRASA is a Python library designed to separate and parametrize aperiodic (fractal) and periodic (oscillatory) components in time series data based on the IRASA algorithm (Wen & Liu, 2016).

Features
--------

- **Aperiodic and Periodic Decomposition:** Utilize the IRASA algorithm to decompose power spectra into aperiodic and periodic components, enabling better interpretation of neurophysiological signals.
- **Time Resolved Spectral Parametrization:** Perform time resolved spectral parametrization, allowing you to track changes in spectral components over time.
- **Support for Raw and Epoched MNE Objects:** PyRASA provides functions designed for both continuous (Raw) and event-related (Epochs) data, making it versatile for various types of EEG/MEG analyses.
- **Consistent Ontology:** PyRASA uses the same jargon to label parameters as specparam, the most commonly used tool to parametrize power spectra, to allow users to easily switch between tools depending on their needs, while keeping the labeling of features consistent.
- **Custom Aperiodic Fit Models:** In addition to the built-in "fixed" and "knee" models for aperiodic fitting, users can specify their custom aperiodic fit functions, offering flexibility in how aperiodic components are modeled.

Example Usage
-------------

Decompose spectra into periodic and aperiodic components::

   from pyrasa.irasa import irasa

   irasa_out = irasa(sig, 
                     fs=fs, 
                     band=(.1, 200), 
                     psd_kwargs={'nperseg': duration*fs, 
                                 'noverlap': duration*fs*overlap
                                },
                     hset_info=(1, 2, 0.05))

Extract periodic parameters::

   irasa_out.get_peaks()

+-----------+-----+--------+--------+
|  ch_name  |  cf |   bw   |   pw   |
+===========+=====+========+========+
|     0     | 9.5 | 1.4426 | 0.4178 |
+-----------+-----+--------+--------+

Extract aperiodic parameters::

   irasa_out.fit_aperiodic_model(fit_func='knee').aperiodic_params

+-----------+--------+--------------+--------------+-----------+--------------------+--------+-----------+
|  Offset   |  Knee  | Exponent_1   | Exponent_2   | fit_type  | Knee Frequency (Hz)|   tau  |  ch_name  |
+===========+========+==============+==============+===========+====================+========+===========+
| 1.737e-16 | 60.94  | 0.0396       | 1.4727       | knee      | 14.131             | 0.0113 |     0     |
+-----------+--------+--------------+--------------+-----------+--------------------+--------+-----------+

And the goodness of fit::

   irasa_out.fit_aperiodic_model(fit_func='knee').gof

+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+
|     mse    | r_squared  |     BIC    |     AIC    | fit_type  |  ch_name  |
+============+============+============+============+===========+===========+
|  0.000051  | 0.999751   | -3931.840  | -3947.806  | knee      |     0     |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+
